# solid-principles
This repository is all about having sample codes on how to achieve solid principles in our coding

- s ----> Single Responsibility Principle
- o ----> Open / Closed Principle
- l ----> Liskov Substitution Principle
- i ----> Interface Segregation Principle
- d ----> Dependency Inversion

**SRP (single responsibility principle)**
- A single code unit which has only 1 responsibility

**OCP (open / closed principle)**
- OCP states that a class should be open only for extension but closed for modification
- OCP is applied only on classes

**Liskov substitution Principle**
- Whenever we are replacing child class with parent class we should not handle special cases
- We can solve the problem by separating the behavior in form of
  Abstract class
  Interfaces
